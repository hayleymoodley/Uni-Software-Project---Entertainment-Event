Uni software project - Entertainment Event

Project Overview / Requirements:

You are required to develop a mobile app to help visitors plan and manage their visit to an entertainment attraction: examples of these may include theme parks, museums, and venues such as theatres and cinemas. You should choose a specific type of venue as your central focus. The app should provide relevant features such as showing users the location of attractions and amenities (e.g. rides, exhibitions, showings, etc. as may be relevant to your chosen example), the ability to purchase and upgrade tickets, obtain information about queuing times (if relevant), and additional elements such as virtual queues, car parking availability, and other aspects that you may consider as important or innovative. Working as a team, you must produce the required materials such as background research, concept designs, project planning, follow development methods, and representative or even working prototypes towards the realisation of such an application.
