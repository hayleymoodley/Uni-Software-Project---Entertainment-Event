Entertainment event venue - Staduim
DRAFT

Current applications include TicketMaster, TagVenue and individual stadium websites such as Weblemy and the London Olympic stadium. 
The individual stadium applications functionality consists of:
  - Booking tickets for the events with the stadium
  - General stadium/venue information
  - Venue hire
  - Lists of events
 
 Larger ticet/venue sites include of TicketMaster and TagVenue. 
 The functionality of these sites include:
 - The ability to search for a range of different events and to be able to book them
 - Range of current events

Based on the above research into current sites, there is a "gap" in having a combination of an application that consists of the both the ability to book
and view a range of different events whilst still containing venue specific info. After further research into entertainment venues other features that these
applications are missing:
- A safe reliably central application that can be used for a any stadium/venue where you can book tickets and also can use whilst being in the venue.
- An app to use in the staduim/venue to order food and refreshments
- An app to use in the stadium/venue to order and view merch without having to wait in queues
- The ability to connect with others who are going to the event alone
- A virtual map displaying important locations

Webiste/Mobile app:
-Currently most ticket/stadiums have webistes and shows a lack of mobile accesibility to use within the venue on smart devices.
// FIND REFERENCES 
As outlined in the following articles. It is is demonstrated that users prefer to use mobile apps/webiste over webistes. Based on this analysis, the 
desicion to create a mobile app was made.

Colours:
The use of colour was decided based on the analysis that the colour impacts the users perception towards the website. The colours red, green and black were
chosen as red is seen as seen to get attention, green as its a calming and black as it modern, portrays power and is seen as a neutral colour.
