Entertainment event venue - Staduim
DRAFT

Current applications include TicketMaster, TagVenue and individual stadium websites such as Weblemy and the London Olympic stadium. 
The individual stadium applications functionality consists of:
  - Booking tickets for the events with the stadium
  - General stadium/venue information
  - Venue hire
  - Lists of events
 
 Larger ticet/venue sites include of TicketMaster and TagVenue. 
 The functionality of these sites include:
 - The ability to search for a range of different events and to be able to book them
 - Range of current events

Based on the above research into current sites, there is a "gap" in having a combination of an application that consists of the both the ability to book
and view a range of different events whilst still containing venue specific info. After further research into entertainment venues other features that these
applications are missing:
- A safe reliably central application that can be used for a any stadium/venue where you can book tickets and also can use whilst being in the venue.
- An app to use in the staduim/venue to order food and refreshments
- An app to use in the stadium/venue to order and view merch without having to wait in queues
- The ability to connect with others who are going to the event alone
- A virtual map displaying important locations

Webiste/Mobile app:
-Currently most ticket/stadiums have webistes and shows a lack of mobile accesibility to use within the venue on smart devices.
